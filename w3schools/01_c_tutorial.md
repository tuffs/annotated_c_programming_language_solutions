## Learn C

C is a general purpose programming language that has been widely used
for over 50 years. C is very powerful; it has been used to develop
operating systems, databases, applications, etc.

## Example

```c

int main() {
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}

```

## C Introduction

### What is C?
C is a general purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at
Bell Laboritories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for
its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of
computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the
UNIX operating system.

### Why Learn C?
- It is one o fthe most popular programming languages in the world
- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular
  programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the
syntax is similar.
- If you know C, you will understand how computer memory works.
- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and
  Python
- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and
  technologies

### Difference between C and C++
- C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost
  the same syntax.
- The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and
  objects, while C does not.

### Example
C is often used in everyday programming tasks, like saying hello to a
user.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[] = "John";
    printf("Hello %s", name); // print Hello John
    return 0; // exit with zero (success)
}

```
