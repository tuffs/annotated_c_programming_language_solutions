# Variables in C

---

Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and
characters.

In C, there are different *types* of variables (defined with different
keywords), for example:

-`int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as
`123` or `-123`.
-`float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as `19.99`
or `-19.99`
- `char` - stores single characters, such as `'a'` or `'B'`. Characters
  are surrounded by *single quotes*.

## Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, specify the *type* and assign it a *value*:

```c

type variableName = value;

// or

type varName; // you don't have to give a variable an initial value.

```

Where _type_ is one of C types (such as `int`), and _variablename_ is
the name of the variables (such as *x* or *myName*). The *equal sign* is
used to assign a value to the variable.

So, to create a variable that should *store a number*, look at the
following example:

```c

int myNum = 16;

```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign
the value later.

```c

// Declare a variable
int myNum;

// Assign a value to the variable
myNum = 25;

```

## Output Variables

You learned from the output chapter that you can output values/text with
the `printf()` function:

```c

printf("Hello World");

```

In many other programming languages (like Python, Java, C++), you would
normally use a *print function* to display the value of a variable.
However, this is not possible in C:

```c

int myNum = 15;
printf(myNum); // nothing happens

```

To output variables in C, you must get familiar with something called
"format specifiers", which you will learn about in the next chapter.
