# C Switch

Switch Statements

Instead of writing _many_ `if..else` statements, you can use the
`switch` statement.

The `switch` statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.

```c

switch (expression) {
    case x:
        // code...
        break;    
    case y:
        // code...
        break;
    default:
        // code...
}

```

This is how it works:

- The `switch` expression is evaluated once
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each
  `case`
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
- The `break` statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the
  execution.
- The `default` statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if
  there is no case match

The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```c

int day = 4;

switch(day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        printf("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        printf("Friday");
        break;
    case 6:
        printf("Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        printf("Sunday");
        break;
} // Outputs Thursday, 4

```

## The break Keyword

When C reaches a `break` keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the
block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There
is no need for more testing.

"""
A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the
execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.
"""

## The default Keyword

The `default` keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case
match:

```c

int day = 4;

switch (day) {
    case 6:
        printf("Today is Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        printf("Today is Sunday");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Looking forward to the Weekend.");
}

```

*Note*: The default keyword must be used as the last statement in the
switch, and it does not need a break.
