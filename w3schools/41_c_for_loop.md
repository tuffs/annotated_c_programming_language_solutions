# For Loops in C

---

For Loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of
code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.

## Syntax

```

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
    // code block to be executed
}

```

`Expression 1` is executed (one time) before the execution of the code
block.
`Expression 2` defines the condition for executing the code block
`Expression 3` is executed (every loop/time) AFTER the code block has
been executed.

## Print Numbers

The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:

## Example

```c

int i;

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}

```

## Example Explained
- Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts: `int i = 0`
- Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run `i < 5`. If the
  condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the
  loop will end.
- Statement 3 increases a value each time the code block in the loop has
  been executed: `i++`

## Print Even Numbers

```c

int i;

for (i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}

```

## Sum of Numbers

```c

int sum = 0;
int i;

for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    sum = sum + i;
}

printf("Sum is %d", sum);

```

## Countdown

This example prints a countdown from 5 to 1:

```c

int i;

for (i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}

```
