# Arrays in C

---

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead
of declaring separate variables for each value.

To create an array, define the data type (like `int`) and specify the
name of the array followed by `square brackets[]`.

To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list inside curly braces,
and make sure all values are of the same data type:

## Example

```c

int myNumbers[] = {25,50,75,100};

```

We have now created a variable that holds an array of four integers.

## Access the Elements of an Array

To access an array element, refer to its `index number`.
Array indexes start with `0`: [0] is the first element [1] is the second
element, etc.
This statement assesses the value of the `first element [0]` in
`myNumbers`:

```c

int myNumbers[] = {25,50,75,100};
printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);

```

## Change an Array Element

To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number.

```c

myNumbers[0] = 33;

```

```c

int myNumbers[] = {25,50,75,100};
myNumbers[0] = 33;

printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);

// Now outputs 33 instead of 25

```

## Set Array Size

Another common way to create arrays, is to specify the size of the
array, and add elements later.

```c

// Declare an array of four integers:
int myNumbers[4];

// Add elements
myNumbers[0] = 25;
myNumbers[1] = 50;
myNumbers[2] = 75;
myNumbers[3] = 100;

```

Using this method, *you should know the number of array elements in
advance*, in order for the program to store enough memory.

You are not able to change the size of the array after creation.

## Avoid Mixing Data Types

It is important to note that all elements in an array *must be of the
same data type*.

This means you cannot mix different types of values, like `integers` and
`floating point` numbers, in the same array.

```c

int myArray[] = {25, 50, 75, 3.15, 5.99}; // inconcurrent data types
(floats)

```

In the example above the values `3.15` and `5.99` will be truncated to
`3` and `5`. In some cases it might also result in an error, so it is
important to always make sure that the elements in the array are of the
same type.
