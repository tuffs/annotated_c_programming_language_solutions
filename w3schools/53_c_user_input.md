# User Input in C

---

You have already learn that `printf()` is used to _output values_ in C.
To get _user input_ you can use the `scanf()` function.

Output a number entered by the user

```c

// Create an integer variable that will store the number we get from
// the user
int myNum;

// Ask the user to type a number
printf("Type a number: \n");

// Get and save the number the user types
scanf("%d", &myNum);

// Output the number the user typed
printf("You number is: %d", myNum);

```

"""

The `scanf()` function takes two arguments: the format specifier of the
variable (`%d` in the example above) and the reference operator
(`&myNum`), which stores the memory address of the variable.

`&myNum` has `&` prepended to the variable to store the memory address
back to it.

*Tip*: You will learn more about memory addresses and functions in the
next chapter.

## Multiple Inputs

The `scanf()` function also allows multiple inputs (an integer and a
character in the following example).


```c

// Create an int and a char variable
int myNum;
char myChar;

// Ask the user to type a number AND a character
printf("Type a number AND a character and press enter: \n");

// Get and save the number AND character the user types
scanf(%d %c", &myNum, &myChar);

// Print the number
printf("Your number is: %d\n", myNum);

// Print the character
printf("Your character is: %c\n", myChar);

```

## Take String Input

You can also get a string entered by the user

```c

// Create a string
char firstName[30];

// Ask the user to input some text
printf("Enter your first name: \n");

// Get and save the text
scanf("%s", firstName);

// Output the text
printf("Hello %s", firstName);

```

*Note*: When working with string in `scanf()` you must specify the size
of the string/array (we used a very high number, 30 in our example, but
at least then we are certain it will store enough characters for the
first name), and you don't have to use the reference operator (`&`).

However, the `scanf()` function has some limitations; it considers space
(whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character, which means that it
can only display a single word (even if you type many words). For
exapmle:

```c

char fullName[30];

printf("Type your full name: \n");
scanf("%s", &fullName);

printf("Hello %s", fullName);

// Type your full name: John Doe
// Hello John

```

From the example above, you would expect the program to print "John Doe"
but it only prints "John".

That's why, when working with strings, we often use the `fgets()`
functino to _read a line of text_. Note that you must include the
following arguments: the name of the string variable,
`sizeof(string_name)`, and `stdin`:


```c
char fullName[30];

printf("Type your full name: \n");

fgets(fullName, sizeof(fullName), stdin);

printf("Hello %s", fullName);

```

"""
Use the `scanf()` function to get a single word as input, and use
`fgets()` for multiple words.
