# Exercise 1.1, "The C Programming Language"
---

We will start our journey together like all, one step at a time. It is my sincere hope that you are able to complete and enjoy the following curriculum. In the beginning, the concepts used in programming were difficult for me, that inspiration to learn what I did not completely understand is what drives me to create this accompanyment of documentation.

I will warn you that the only inspiration and guidance provided throughout this set of examples and exercises will be from Dr. "Chuck" Severance at https://cc4e.com - I believe that the heart of his message in video format resonated wildly within me and his instruction and work will also be an influence on my work here.
