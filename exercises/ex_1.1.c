// Example 1.1
// from "The C Programming Language"

// All exercises in this folder are directly inspired by
// the "The C Programming Language Book" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
// All of my examples are from the YouTube instructor "Dr. Chuck" at cc4e.com

// These examples attempt to capture the heart and understanding of
// the original book through the viewers lens and will demonstrate how
// it is possible to learn the C programming language in 2025 for free
// and very thoroughly.

// While there have been several changes to the C programming language, this
// is my personal attempt to recapture a peice of programmign history by
// learning what was originally invisioned for the C programming language as
// this book was commissioned by Bell Labs (AT&T) in the 1970s.

// What better way might there be to learn programming than through this lens?

// Each Example exercise completed will take into account the last comleted,
// the breadth of information learned, and will attempt to expound upon the
// previously taught and current lessons.

// I will be providing documentation for each exercise file that is in this
// repository in the ~/documentation/ex_*.md file that corresponds with
// the exercise file written in The C Programming Language for additional and
// hopefully remarkable resource for free.

// Knowledge is power and the internet brings freedom, if you can keep them
// these are two of the most powerful commodities available under the sun
// aside from time. That being said, I hope that you enjoy these examples
// and learn more each day!
