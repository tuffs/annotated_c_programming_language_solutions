# The C Programming Language, Annotated in Files

---

This is project annotation and accompanyment from the original "The C Programming Language" book which has been wildly popular and important to the history of computer programming, budding engineers, and enthusiasts alike. It is my hope that anyone seeking the skill of the software engineer will find all of the text herein relevant and understandable.

I have gone to great lengths to ensure that the concepts presented at each level of this book are covered extremely well and with all due caution. My intent is to guide you through the book with a set of completed and annotated exerises that might help you see why C works the way that it does and provide answers to the beginner and seasoned programmer alike.

In this repo you will find an exercises and documentation folder with ex_1.1.c or ex_1.1.md file in ascending order to complete the exercises in "The C Programming Language" with a bit more explanation and in a cresendo of learned topics style of implementation for maximum understanding of the topics at hand.

# What to Expect

Please note that while I will be providing a large amount of textual details, expounding on solutions to exercises, and providing my own personal take on the C programming language, you will notice that I will not be holding your hand as you take your journey into the C programming language and writing applications. I expect the you, the reader, to be able to search the ineternet, make use of AI, or ask your friends and colleagues for support where not provided. This is intentional and my omission of particulars from time to time may be more of an intention than an accidental omission. This is important for the modern programmer, there is an actual skill to be had in doing research throughout life and this is one of those times where you will need to get resourceful when you do not understand something. It is my strong belief that you already posess the tools and skills needed to accomplish whatever you desire in life from programming to marriage and beyond, and with that, comes a responsibility for you to find your own way. Make yourself useful by honing your Google-fu, mastering prompts to AI, scouring Stack Overflow or even YouTube for the answers you need to participate effectively in this journey!

I will provide you with as much help as I can, however, I can not make you drink the water. With that said, I hope that you enjoy and find useful the information provided herein and without further comment, I will leave you to the solutions I have provided. I hope that my text, solutions, and resources can be of great help along your personal programming learning experience. Never pay for something that has been already provided to you for free!
