# The C Programming Language, Annotated in Files
---

This is project annotation and accompanyment from the original "The C Programming Language" book which has been wildly popular and important to the history of computer programming, budding engineers, and enthusiasts alike. It is my hope that anyone seeking the skill of the software engineer will find all of the text herein relevant and understandable.

I have gone to great lengths to ensure that the concepts presented at each level of this book are covered extremely well and with all due caution. My intent is to guide you through the book with a set of completed and annotated exerises that might help you see why C works the way that it does and provide answers to the beginner and seasoned programmer alike.

In this repo you will find an exercises and documentation folder with ex_1.1.c or ex_1.1.md file in ascending order to complete the exercises in "The C Programming Language" with a bit more explanation and in a cresendo of learned topics style of implementation for maximum understanding of the topics at hand.
